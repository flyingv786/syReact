		          I'm a Senior Software/Creative Engineer with over 10 years of experience assisting industry leading 
		          brands. Downtown Chicago is where I generally drop-in but ride the wind as I sea fit. I have engineered all areas of the stack (database/server-side/front-end) and specialize in the presentation layer.
		          I aim to fuse engineering and design in ways that would make nature proud. 
		        </p>

		        <p>I'm passionate about UX/Design and strive for a good combination of minimalism, elegance and performance. 
		          There aren't many digital/architectural challenges I haven't already solved for across a wide variety of industries.
		        </p>

		        <p>I've been extremely fortunate to have worked with organizations and special individuals along the way â€” 
		          who are undoubtedly the best at what they do.
		        </p>
		        <p>
		          My own special-unique abilities include having excellent taste 
		           and adopting the categorical imperative - the principles of universalizability.
		           It turns out that all of these are the direct result of a genuine commitment to excellent products and 
		           customer service. Something that can't be faked - priceless... 
		        </p>

		        <p>Whether you need help driving conversion or simply sharing valuable content with the world - I can give your digital product the best chance it has.
